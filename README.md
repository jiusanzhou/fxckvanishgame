# Fxck the Vanish Game

**:warning: Just for fun, from the party of some company from Hanzhou!**

**Notice: I just given a POC, if you want to do something with it you shoud finish the code.**

> Last year I fxcked the vanish, this year I can do it again. The team just so native, no one care about the security stuff. Maybe the other products of the company get the same situation. Engineer are smart, team are terrible.

## Enjoy your day
